# Slack SDK for Java

**Slack SDK for Java** supports all public Slack platform functionality in a Java idiomatic way. The SDK is completely written in Java, so that developers can use this SDK in any JVM language, including Kotlin, Groovy, and Scala without any hurdles.

The SDK offers two different modules depending on what platform features you intend to use:

* [**Slack API Client**]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/guides/web-api-basics) for calling a variety of Slack APIs
* [**Bolt for Java**]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/guides/getting-started-with-bolt) Framework for Slack App development with full platform features

If what you want to do is call Slack APIs in your existing services, we recommend using only the **Slack API Client**. If instead, you’re developing a new modern and interactive Slack app, we recommend **Bolt** for it. The framework enables developers to focus on the essential parts of their apps without being bothered by trifles.

## Modules

The table below shows all the available modules. All of them have the same latest version as we release all at the same time, even in the case that some don't have any changes apart from updates on their dependency side.

All released versions are available on the Maven Central repositories. The latest version is **{{ site.sdkLatestVersion }}**.

## Requirements

The SDK supports **OpenJDK 8 and higher LTS versions**.

Users can expect every single patch release has been done after verifying functionalities by running [the basic CI builds with all LTS versions](https://github.com/slackapi/java-slack-sdk/blob/master/.travis.yml) and all the unit tests have passed at least on the latest LTS version. We don't run comprehensive verifications with all OpenJDK distributions but it should be working with all of them.
